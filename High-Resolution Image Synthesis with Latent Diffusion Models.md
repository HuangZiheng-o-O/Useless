This passage provides an overview of the recent advancements in image synthesis within the field of computer vision, highlighting the challenges and comparing various models. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

#### Context and Challenges:
1. **Spectacular Development vs. Computational Demands**:
   - Image synthesis has seen tremendous advancements recently, but it also demands significant computational resources.
   - High-resolution synthesis of complex natural scenes typically relies on scaling up likelihood-based models, which can include billions of parameters, such as autoregressive (AR) transformers.

#### Comparisons Between Models:
1. **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**:
   - GANs have shown promising results in certain domains.
   - However, their performance is often limited to data with less variability because their adversarial learning procedure doesn’t scale well for complex, multi-modal distributions.

2. **Diffusion Models**:
   - Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive results in image synthesis.
   - These models are constructed from a hierarchy of denoising autoencoders.
   - They have set the state-of-the-art in class-conditional image synthesis and super-resolution.
   - Unlike GANs, diffusion models do not suffer from mode-collapse or training instabilities because they are likelihood-based models.
   - They also leverage parameter sharing to model highly complex distributions of natural images without the need for billions of parameters.

#### Empirical Results:
1. **Comparative Performance**:
   - The passage presents a comparison of different models on the DIV2K validation set, evaluated at 512x512 pixels.
   - **Metrics Used**:
     - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): A measure of reconstruction quality.
     - R-FID (Reconstruction Fréchet Inception Distance): Evaluates the quality and diversity of generated images.
   - **Models Compared**:
     - **Ours (f = 4)**: PSNR: 27.4, R-FID: 0.58.
     - **DALL-E (f = 8)**: PSNR: 22.8, R-FID: 32.01.
     - **VQGAN (f = 16)**: PSNR: 19.9, R-FID: 4.98.
   - The results indicate that the diffusion model (referred to as "ours") achieves higher quality with less aggressive downsampling.

#### Advantages of Diffusion Models:
1. **Inductive Bias for Spatial Data**:
   - Diffusion models are particularly effective for spatial data, allowing less aggressive spatial downsampling compared to other generative models.
   - This enables a significant reduction in data dimensionality while maintaining high reconstruction quality.

2. **Applications Beyond Image Synthesis**:
   - Diffusion models can also be applied to various tasks such as inpainting, colorization, and stroke-based synthesis.
   - They perform well in these areas without the mode-collapse and training instabilities that affect GANs.

#### Conclusion:
The passage underscores the effectiveness of diffusion models in high-resolution image synthesis, their ability to handle complex distributions, and their robustness compared to other generative models like GANs and AR transformers.

This passage discusses the challenges and potential solutions for making high-resolution image synthesis more accessible and less resource-intensive, particularly focusing on diffusion models (DMs). Here's a detailed explanation:

## Challenges with Diffusion Models (DMs):
1. **Likelihood-Based Models**:
   - DMs are likelihood-based models, which means they aim to cover all possible modes of the data distribution.
   - This behavior can lead to excessive modeling of imperceptible details, consuming significant computational resources.

2. **High Computational Demands**:
   - Training and evaluating DMs require repeated function evaluations and gradient computations in the high-dimensional space of RGB images.
   - The reweighted variational objective aims to reduce some of this burden by undersampling initial denoising steps, but DMs remain computationally demanding.

3. **Resource Consumption**:
   - Training powerful DMs can take hundreds of GPU days (e.g., 150 to 1000 V100 GPU days as mentioned in the reference).
   - Inference (producing samples) is also resource-intensive, with 50,000 samples taking about 5 days on a single A100 GPU.
   - This limits accessibility to those with substantial computational resources and contributes to a significant carbon footprint.

#### Observations and Challenges:

1. **Costly Function Evaluations in Pixel Space**:
   - Diffusion models require expensive function evaluations in the high-dimensional pixel space, leading to significant computation time and energy consumption.
   - While these models can ignore perceptually irrelevant details by undersampling the loss terms, the overall computational demands remain high.

#### Proposed Solution:
1. **Separation of Compressive and Generative Phases**:
   - The solution is to introduce an explicit separation between the compressive phase (where data is compressed) and the generative phase (where images are synthesized).
   - This is achieved using an autoencoding model.

2. **Autoencoding Model**:
   - The autoencoding model learns a latent space that is perceptually equivalent to the original image space but has significantly reduced computational complexity.
   - By encoding images into a lower-dimensional latent space, the computational burden is reduced.

#### Advantages of the Proposed Approach:
1. **Efficiency in Low-Dimensional Space**:
   - By moving from the high-dimensional image space to a lower-dimensional latent space, diffusion models become much more computationally efficient.
   - Sampling and other operations are performed in this reduced space, saving time and resources.

2. **Effective Use of Inductive Bias**:
   - The approach leverages the inductive bias of diffusion models derived from their UNet architecture.
   - This makes the models particularly effective for data with spatial structure, reducing the need for aggressive compression that can degrade quality.
   - Previous approaches required heavy compression, which often compromised the quality of the generated images.

3. **Versatility of the Latent Space**:
   - The learned latent space can serve multiple purposes beyond just the specific generative task.
   - It can be used to train various generative models.
   - It is also useful for other downstream applications, such as single-image CLIP-guided synthesis, where a single image can be used to guide the synthesis process according to a specific prompt or condition.

#### Summary:
To make high-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models more efficient, the proposed method involves using an autoencoding model to separate the compressive and generative phases. This reduces computational complexity by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space, leverages the inductive bias of the UNet architecture to maintain quality, and provides a versatile latent space that can be used for multiple generative and downstream tasks. This approach offers a significant reduction in computational demands, making high-resolution image synthesis more accessible and efficient.

The provided screenshots describe a perceptual image compression model and its components. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key points:

#### Perceptual Image Compression Model

##### Basis and Objective:
- **Previous Work**: The model is based on prior research and combines a perceptual loss and a patch-based adversarial objective.
- **Purpose**: To ensure that reconstructions are confined to the image manifold, enforcing local realism and avoiding the blurriness often introduced by relying solely on pixel-space losses like L2 or L1 objectives.

##### Methodology:
1. **Autoencoder Architecture**:
   - **Encoder** $$ \mathcal{E} $$: Encodes the input image $$ x $$ into a latent representation $$ z = \mathcal{E}(x) $$.
   - **Decoder** $$ \mathcal{D} $$: Reconstructs the image from the latent space, $$ \tilde{x} = \mathcal{D}(z) = \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{E}(x)) $$.
   - The encoder down-samples the image by a factor $$ f $$, and different down-sampling factors $$ f = 2^m $$ are investigated.

2. **Avoiding High-Variance Latent Spaces**:
   - **Regularization**:
     - **KL Regularization (KL-reg)**: Imposes a KL-penalty towards a standard normal distribution on the learned latent space, similar to a VAE.
     - **Vector Quantization Regularization (VQ-reg)**: Uses a vector quantization layer within the decoder, akin to VQGAN, but with the quantization layer absorbed by the decoder.

##### Advantages:
- **Efficiency**: By moving from the high-dimensional image space to a lower-dimensional latent space, DMs become computationally efficient.
- **Inductive Bias**: The UNet architecture of DMs is particularly effective for data with spatial structure, reducing the need for aggressive compression.
- **Versatility**: The latent space can be used to train multiple generative models and for downstream applications like single-image CLIP-guided synthesis.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Compression and Reconstruction**:
   - The model compresses the image into a latent representation and reconstructs it while maintaining high quality.
   - The latent space is two-dimensional, allowing the use of mild compression rates to achieve good reconstructions.

2. **Comparison with Previous Works**:
   - Previous works relied on arbitrary 1D ordering of the latent space to model its distribution autoregressively, ignoring the inherent structure of the latent space.
   - The proposed model preserves the structural details of the original image better.

#### Conclusion:
The perceptual image compression model leverages a combination of perceptual and adversarial objectives to maintain local realism and avoid blurriness. The use of regularization techniques like KL-reg and VQ-reg helps in maintaining a stable and efficient latent space, facilitating high-quality reconstructions with reduced computational complexity.

The screenshot describes the concept of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and their application in image synthesis. Here's a detailed explanation of the content:

#### Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)

##### Overview:
- **Diffusion Models**:
  - Probabilistic models designed to learn a data distribution $$ p(x) $$ by gradually denoising a normally distributed variable.
  - This process is akin to learning the reverse process of a fixed Markov Chain of length $$ T $$.

##### Image Synthesis:
- **Successful Models**:
  - The most successful models for image synthesis rely on a reweighted variant of the variational lower bound on $$ p(x) $$.
  - This approach mirrors denoising score-matching techniques.
  - Examples of such models are cited from works [15, 30, 72, 85].

##### Model Interpretation:
- **Denoising Autoencoders**:
  - These models can be interpreted as an equally weighted sequence of denoising autoencoders $$ \epsilon_\theta (x_t, t) $$ for $$ t = 1, \ldots, T $$.
  - Each autoencoder is trained to predict a denoised variant of its input $$ x_t $$, where $$ x_t $$ is a noisy version of the original input $$ x $$.

##### Objective Function:
- **Simplified Objective**:
  - The objective of the model can be simplified as:
    $$
    L_{DM} = \mathbb{E}_{x, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), t} \left[ \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta (x_t, t) \right\|_2^2 \right]
    $$
  - Here, $$ t $$ is uniformly sampled from $$\{1, \ldots, T\} $$.

#### Key Points:
- **Probabilistic Nature**:
  - LDMs are inherently probabilistic, aiming to model the distribution of data through a process of denoising.
- **Sequential Denoising**:
  - The denoising process is conducted through a series of autoencoders, each responsible for denoising at a specific step in the Markov Chain.
- **Training and Inference**:
  - The model is trained to predict denoised versions of noisy inputs, utilizing a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted noise and the actual noise.

The screenshots elaborate on the generative modeling of latent representations using the trained perceptual compression models. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key points:

#### Generative Modeling of Latent Representations

##### Efficient Low-Dimensional Latent Space:
- **Trained Perceptual Compression Models**:
  - Utilizing the encoder $$ \mathcal{E} $$ and decoder $$ \mathcal{D} $$ from the perceptual compression models, an efficient low-dimensional latent space is accessed.
  - High-frequency, imperceptible details are abstracted away in this latent space.

- **Advantages Over High-Dimensional Pixel Space**:
  - The latent space is more suitable for likelihood-based generative models as it allows focusing on important, semantic bits of the data.
  - Training is conducted in a lower-dimensional, computationally more efficient space.

##### Comparison to Previous Work:
- **Autoregressive and Attention-Based Transformer Models**:
  - Previous approaches relied on these models in a highly compressed, discrete latent space.
  - The current method leverages image-specific inductive biases offered by the model, utilizing 2D convolutional layers primarily.

##### Inductive Bias and Efficiency:
- **UNet Architecture**:
  - The model builds the underlying UNet primarily from 2D convolutional layers.
  - The focus is on perceptually relevant bits using a reweighted bound.

- **Reweighted Bound Objective**:
  - The objective is expressed as:
    $$
    L_{LDM} := \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{E}(x), \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), t} \left[ \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta (z_t, t) \right\|_2^2 \right]
    $$
  - This formulation targets the most perceptually relevant bits in the latent space.

##### Neural Backbone:
- **Time-Conditional UNet**:
  - The neural backbone $$ \epsilon_\theta (o, t) $$ is realized as a time-conditional UNet.
  - During training, $$ z_t $$ is efficiently obtained from $$ \mathcal{E} $$, and samples from $$ p(z) $$ are decoded to image space with a single pass through $$ \mathcal{D} $$.

#### Summary:
The generative modeling of latent representations using perceptual compression models provides an efficient, low-dimensional latent space, abstracting away high-frequency details. This approach enhances computational efficiency and leverages the inductive biases of UNet architecture. It focuses on the most perceptually relevant details using a reweighted bound objective, facilitating effective and efficient training and sampling.

The screenshots explain the conditioning mechanisms for latent diffusion models (LDMs) and how these mechanisms are implemented to make the models more flexible and effective. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### Conditioning Mechanisms

##### Overview:
- **Conditional Generative Models**:
  - Similar to other generative models, diffusion models can model conditional distributions $$ p(z|y) $$ using a conditional denoising autoencoder $$ \epsilon_\theta(z_t, t, y) $$.
  - This allows control over the synthesis process using inputs $$ y $$ such as text, semantic maps, or other image-to-image translation tasks.

##### Current Research Gaps:
- **Limited Exploration**:
  - While class-labels and blurred variants of the input image have been used as conditions, combining the generative power of DMs with other types of conditionings remains under-explored.

##### Proposed Method:
1. **Flexible Conditional Image Generators**:
   - The underlying UNet backbone of DMs is augmented with a cross-attention mechanism.
   - This mechanism is effective for learning attention-based models of various input modalities.

2. **Pre-processing with Domain-Specific Encoder**:
   - To handle various modalities (e.g., language prompts), a domain-specific encoder $$ \tau_\theta $$ projects $$ y $$ to an intermediate representation $$ \tau_\theta(y) $$.
   - This intermediate representation is mapped to the intermediate layers of the UNet via a cross-attention layer.

##### Cross-Attention Mechanism:
- **Attention Calculation**:
  - Attention is implemented as:
    $$
    \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) \cdot V
    $$
  - Where:
    - $$ Q = W_Q^{(i)} \cdot \varphi_i(z_t) $$
    - $$ K = W_K^{(i)} \cdot \tau_\theta(y) $$
    - $$ V = W_V^{(i)} \cdot \tau_\theta(y) $$
  - Here, $$ \varphi_i(z_t) $$ denotes a (flattened) intermediate representation of the UNet implementing $$ \epsilon_\theta $$.

3. **Learnable Projections**:
  - $$ W_Q^{(i)}, W_K^{(i)}, W_V^{(i)} $$ are learnable projection matrices.
  - These facilitate the transformation of the intermediate representations into a form suitable for attention-based modeling.

##### Learning the Conditional LDM:
- **Objective Function**:
  - The conditional LDM is learned via:
    $$
    L_{LDM} := \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{E}(x), y, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), t} \left[ \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta (z_t, t, \tau_\theta(y)) \right\|_2^2 \right]
    $$
  - Both $$ \tau_\theta $$ and $$ \epsilon_\theta $$ are jointly optimized.

##### Flexibility:
- **Parameterization**:
  - The conditioning mechanism is flexible, allowing $$ \tau_\theta $$ to be parameterized with domain-specific experts (e.g., unmasked transformers when $$ y $$ are text prompts).

#### Summary:
The conditioning mechanisms for LDMs involve augmenting the UNet backbone with a cross-attention mechanism to handle various input modalities effectively. By pre-processing the conditional inputs through a domain-specific encoder and utilizing learnable projections, the model can flexibly integrate different types of conditions, making it more versatile and powerful in generating conditioned outputs.

2. **Cross-Attention Layers**:
   - **Query (Q)**: Derived from the intermediate representation $$ \varphi_i(z_t) $$ within the UNet.
   - **Key (K) and Value (V)**: Derived from the conditioning input $$ \tau_\theta(y) $$.

   The cross-attention mechanism aligns the intermediate UNet representation with the conditioning input to influence the denoising process.

3. **Switch and Skip Connections**:
   - **Switch**: Controls the flow between different paths in the architecture.
   - **Skip Connection**: Allows information to bypass certain layers, aiding in the preservation of important features.
   - **Concatenation**: Combines different streams of data to form a unified input for subsequent processing.

#### Objective Function:

The conditional LDM is trained using the following objective:
$$
L_{LDM} := \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{E}(x), y, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), t} \left[ \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta (z_t, t, \tau_\theta(y)) \right\|_2^2 \right]
$$
Both $$ \tau_\theta $$ and $$ \epsilon_\theta $$ are optimized to align the latent representation with the conditioning inputs effectively.

#### Summary:
This architecture allows the LDM to handle various forms of conditional inputs, enhancing its flexibility and effectiveness in generating high-quality, conditioned images. The use of a cross-attention mechanism within the UNet backbone ensures that the model can integrate semantic, textual, and other conditioning information seamlessly.

  - The BERT-tokenizer is used, and $$ \tau_\theta $$ is implemented as a transformer to infer a latent code, which is mapped into the UNet via multi-head cross-attention.
  - This domain-specific expert approach for learning language representations and visual synthesis results in a powerful model that generalizes well to complex, user-defined text prompts.

###### Evaluation and Results:
- **Quantitative Analysis**:
  - Text-to-image generation is evaluated on the MS-COCO validation set.
  - The model improves upon powerful autoregressive (AR) and GAN-based methods.
  - Classifier-free diffusion guidance greatly boosts sample quality, making the guided LDM-KL-8-G on par with recent state-of-the-art AR and diffusion models for text-to-image synthesis while significantly reducing parameter count.

- **Additional Analysis**:
  - The flexibility of the cross-attention based conditioning mechanism is further analyzed by training models to synthesize images based on semantic layouts on OpenImages and fine-tuning on COCO.
  - For detailed quantitative evaluation and implementation, see the referenced sections.

###### Class-Conditional ImageNet Models:
- **Best-Performing Models**:
  - The best-performing class-conditional ImageNet models with $$ f \in \{4, 8\} $$ from the previous section are evaluated.
  - These models outperform the state-of-the-art diffusion model ADM, significantly reducing computational requirements and parameter count.

#### Summary:

The screenshots discuss convolutional sampling beyond $$256^2$$ resolution and super-resolution using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Here's a detailed explanation:

#### 4.3.2 Convolutional Sampling Beyond $$256^2$$

##### Efficient General-Purpose Image-to-Image Translation:
- **Spatially Aligned Conditioning**:
  - By concatenating spatially aligned conditioning information to the input of $$ \epsilon_\theta $$, LDMs can serve as efficient general-purpose image-to-image translation models.
- **Training Models**:
  - Models are trained for tasks like semantic synthesis, super-resolution, and inpainting.
  - For semantic synthesis, images of landscapes paired with semantic maps are used. Downsampled versions of the semantic maps are concatenated with the latent image representation of an $$ f = 4 $$ model (VQ-reg).
  - Training is done on an input resolution of $$ 256^2 $$ (cropped from $$ 384^2 $$, but the model can generalize to larger resolutions and generate images up to the megapixel regime when evaluated in a convolutional manner.

##### Super-Resolution and Inpainting:
- **Application**:
  - This approach is used for super-resolution models to generate large images between $$ 512^2 $$ and $$ 1024^2 $$.
  - The signal-to-noise ratio (influenced by the scale of the latent space) significantly affects the results.
- **Illustration**:
  - Section D.1 provides illustrations of learning an LDM on the latent space provided by an $$ f = 4 $$ model (KL-reg) and a rescaled version scaled by the component-wise standard deviation.

##### Direct Synthesis of High-Resolution Images:
- **Classifier-Free Guidance**:
  - This technique, in combination with classifier-free guidance, enables the direct synthesis of images larger than $$ 256^2 $$ for text-conditional LDM-KL-8-G.

#### 4.4. Super-Resolution with Latent Diffusion

##### Efficient Training:
- **Super-Resolution**:
  - LDMs can be efficiently trained for super-resolution by directly conditioning on low-resolution images via concatenation (as described in Section 3.3).
- **First Experiment**:
  - Following the SR3 approach, LDMs are conditioned on low-resolution images to produce higher-resolution outputs.

#### Example Figure:

- **Figure 9**:
  - Shows an LDM trained on $$ 256^2 $$ resolution and its ability to generalize to larger resolutions (e.g., $$ 512 \times 1024 $$ for spatially conditioned tasks such as semantic synthesis of landscape images.

#### Summary:
LDMs demonstrate significant flexibility and efficiency in handling tasks beyond simple image generation, including semantic synthesis, super-resolution, and inpainting. By using spatially aligned conditioning and leveraging the power of convolutional approaches, LDMs can generate high-resolution images and handle various conditioning modalities effectively.

The screenshots detail the use of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for super-resolution and the evaluation of their performance. Here’s an explanation of the key points:

#### 4.4. Super-Resolution with Latent Diffusion

##### Efficient Training:
- **LDMs for Super-Resolution**:
  - LDMs are trained for super-resolution by conditioning on low-resolution images via concatenation.
  - The approach follows the SR3 methodology.

##### Experimental Setup:
- **Training Process**:
  - The image degradation is fixed to bicubic interpolation with 4x-downsampling.
  - Training is conducted on ImageNet using SR3's data processing pipeline.
  - An autoencoding model pretrained on OpenImages (VQ-reg) with $$ f = 4 $$ is used.
  - The low-resolution conditioning $$ y $$ and the inputs to the UNet $$ \tau_\theta $$ as the identity) are concatenated.

##### Results:
- **Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis**:
  - The results show competitive performance.
  - LDM-SR outperforms SR3 in FID while SR3 has a better Inception Score (IS).
  - A simple image regression model achieves the highest PSNR and SSIM scores, but these do not align well with human perception as they favor blurriness over high-frequency details.

- **User Study**:
  - A user study compared the pixel-baseline with LDM-SR.
  - Subjects were shown low-res images between two high-res images and asked for preference.
  - Results confirm the good performance of LDM-SR.
  - PSNR and SSIM can be improved with a post-hoc guiding mechanism using an image-based guider via a perceptual loss.

#### Evaluation Metrics:

##### Table 4: User Study Results
- **Super-Resolution on ImageNet**:
  - Task 1: Preference vs. Ground Truth (GT)
    - Pixel-DM $$ f = 1 $$: 16.0%
    - LDM-4: 30.4%
  - Task 2: Preference Score
    - Pixel-DM $$ f = 1 $$: 29.4%
    - LDM-4: 70.6%

- **Inpainting on Places**:
  - Task 1: Preference vs. GT
    - LAMA: 13.6%
    - LDM-4: 21.0%
  - Task 2: Preference Score
    - LAMA: 31.9%
    - LDM-4: 68.1%

#### Addressing Generalization Issues:
- **Bicubic Degradation**:
  - The bicubic degradation process does not generalize well to images that do not follow this pre-processing.
  - A generic model (LDM-BSR) is trained using more diverse degradation techniques, with results shown in Section D.6.1.

#### Summary:
LDMs demonstrate efficient and competitive performance for super-resolution tasks, showing significant improvements in user preference and quantitative metrics over baseline models. The use of concatenation for low-resolution conditioning allows for high-quality image synthesis. The evaluation also highlights the limitations of certain pre-processing methods and the need for more generalized approaches.

The screenshots detail the use of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for inpainting tasks and the evaluation of their performance. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:

#### 4.5. Inpainting with Latent Diffusion

##### Task Definition:
- **Inpainting**:
  - Inpainting involves filling masked regions of an image with new content to replace corrupted or undesired parts.

##### Evaluation:
- **Approach**:
  - The evaluation compares the general approach for conditional image generation to more specialized state-of-the-art methods, following the protocol of LaMa.
  - The exact training and evaluation protocol on the Places dataset is described in Sec. E.2.2.

##### Design Choices:
- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - The inpainting efficiency of LDM-1 (pixel-based conditional DM) is compared with LDM-4 for both KL and VQ regularizations, as well as VQ-LDM-4 without attention in the first stage.
  - The comparison is made by fixing the number of parameters for all models and reporting the training and sampling throughput at resolutions $$256^2$$ and $$512^2$$.
  - Results show a speed-up of at least 2.7x between pixel- and latent-based diffusion models, with improved FID scores by a factor of at least 1.6x.

##### Comparison with Other Inpainting Approaches:
- **Results**:
  - The model with attention improves the overall image quality, as measured by FID, over LaMa.
  - LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) between the unmasked images and samples is slightly higher for LDM, attributed to LaMa producing a single result, while LDM generates diverse results.
  - User studies also show a preference for LDM results over LaMa.

##### Larger Diffusion Model:
- **Training a Larger Model**:
  - A larger diffusion model is trained in the latent space of the VQ-regularized first stage without attention.
  - The UNet uses attention layers on three levels of its feature hierarchy, with the BigGAN residual block for up- and down-sampling, totaling 387M parameters.
  - Discrepancies in quality between resolutions $$256^2$$ and $$512^2$$ were noted, hypothesized to be due to additional attention modules.
  - Fine-tuning the model for half an epoch at resolution $$512^2$$ allows it to adjust to new feature statistics, setting a new state-of-the-art FID for image inpainting.

#### Summary:
LDMs show significant improvements in inpainting tasks over specialized state-of-the-art methods like LaMa. They offer higher speed and better FID scores, and user studies confirm their superior performance. The experiments also highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of LDMs when trained with different regularizations and in larger models, demonstrating the ability to produce high-quality results across various image resolutions.
